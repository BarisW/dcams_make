dcams_make  (openshift branch)
==========

This branch includes a very basic deployment script for openshift. It deploys
the makefile on pushing changes to the openshift hosting. Great for development
and testing, but not going to cut much else - for a start the hosting is down
during the build, and there is no testing etc.
